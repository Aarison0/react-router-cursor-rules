## Introduction

React Router is a powerful library that enables dynamic routing in React applications. It allows you to create single-page applications with navigation that feels seamless. This repository focuses on the cursor rules, which are essential for managing state and navigation effectively.

## Installation

To get started with the React Router Cursor Rules, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aarison0/react-router-cursor-rules.git
cd react-router-cursor-rules
```

After cloning, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start using the cursor rules in your React application. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Cursor Rules

Understanding cursor rules is crucial for effective navigation. Here are some key rules to follow:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain a single state for your application to avoid inconsistencies.
2. **Use Context**: Leverage React Context to manage global state.
3. **Avoid Nested Routers**: Keep your routing structure flat to simplify navigation.
4. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.

### Detailed Rules

- **Rule 1: Single Source of Truth**
  - Always keep your application state in one place. This practice prevents confusion and makes debugging easier.

- **Rule 2: Use Context**
  - React Context allows you to share state across components without prop drilling. Use it to manage user authentication, theme settings, and more.

- **Rule 3: Avoid Nested Routers**
  - Nested routers can complicate your routing logic. Instead, use a flat structure to keep your routes clear and manageable.

- **Rule 4: Error Boundaries**
  - Wrap your routes in error boundaries to catch errors in your components. This practice helps you provide fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples demonstrating the cursor rules in action.

### Example 1: Basic Routing

This example shows how to set up basic routing using React Router.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

### Example 2: Using Context for State Management

In this example, we use React Context to manage user authentication.

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const AuthContext = createContext();

function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

function useAuth() {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
}
```

### Example 3: Implementing Error Boundaries

Hereâ€™s how to implement error boundaries in your routing.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error("Error caught in boundary:", error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```
